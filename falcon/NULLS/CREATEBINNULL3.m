%Cored - Cored null model
%has same dimensions and fill as initial matrix and has a similar degree
%distribution to the orginal matrix. The initial matrix is used as a
%guideline, where elements are randomly removed if the degree distributions
%of rows and columns will not fall to zero. These removed elements are then
%randomly reassigned to empty spaces in the matrix to conserve connectance
%of the input matrix. This method is described in Beckett & Williams, in prep.
