function [MEASURE]=MANHATTAN_DISTANCE(MATRIX)
%The Tau-temperature method based on the Manhattan Distance is described in
%Corso & Britton, 2012. This function returns the Manhattan distance of a
%matrix. The Tau-temperature is calculated as the Manhattan distance of the
%test matrix divided by the expected Manhattan distance as calculated from
%the mean of an ensemble. In FALCON the Tau-temperature is shown as the
%NormalisedTemperature in the outputs.
