    "# Wrapping a MATLAB package in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For work, I had to use some code that is only available in MATLAB. Most of my workflow, though, is in Python, and I didn't want to mix two languages. As any normal person would do, I started looking around for some tutorial on how to wrap MATLAB cleanly in Python. I found none that were satisfying, so I figured it out by myself using MATLAB's documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took me a bit, because my MATLAB is rusty, and the docs aren't exactly great. So I thought I'd do something good for a change, and write a tutorial on how to wrap MATLAB code with Python. I actually did something better, because when you're done with this, you should have a recipe to easily wrap any MATLAB code in a few minutes. Mind that the tutorial presupposes knowledge of the import system, OOP, operator overloading and decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first MATLAB package I ever wrapped is [FALCON](https://github.com/sjbeckett/FALCON), written by [Stephen Beckett](http://sjbeckett.github.io/), so I'll use it as an example to guide you through its wrapping. The code is contained in the [../falcon](https://github.com/ganileni/py_falcon/tree/master/falcon) directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, you need to have a working copy of MATLAB installed on your machine. When you do, install the [MATLAB API for Python](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html). Here are the [installation instructions](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html) but, in short, you can install it with this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd $MATLABROOT/extern/engines/python\n",
    "$ python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `$MATLABROOT` is your MATLAB installation directory (e.g. for my sistem it's `~/.MathWorks/MATLAB/R2018a`). This will put a new package in your Python installation called `matlab`. Of course I advise to do this in a virtualenv or conda environment, and not in your system Python installation.\n",
